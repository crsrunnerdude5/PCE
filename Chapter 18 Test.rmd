## R Markdown
This is just plain markdown that can contain **bold** or _italics_

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

```{r kable_example, echo = FALSE}
library("ggplot2")

ggplot(data = midwest) +
  geom_point(
    mapping = aes(x = percollege, y = percadultpoverty, color = state)
  
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set3")

```



Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
